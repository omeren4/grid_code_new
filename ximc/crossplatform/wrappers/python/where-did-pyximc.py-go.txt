pyximc.py was substituted by new libximc module. YOU CAN USE IT IN THE OLD MANNER - just type `import libximc as ximc` instead of `import pyximc as ximc`.

Benefits of new libximc module:
* no need to copy necessary libraries in correct relative locations - all libraries are inside the libximc directory
* an opportunity to use new convenient OOP-styled API - just use `import libximc.highlevel as ximc` and enjoy
